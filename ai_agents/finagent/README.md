## Claude Desktop Integration

### Setup MCP Server with Claude Desktop

1. **Install Claude Desktop**:

   - Download from [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai/download)
   - Install and launch the application

2. **Configure MCP Server**:

   Locate your Claude Desktop config file:

   - **MacOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

3. **Add Finagent Server**:

   Edit the config file and add:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "financial-analyst": {
         "command": "python",
         "args": ["/absolute/path/to/finagent/main.py"],
         "env": {
           "MISTRAL_API_KEY": "your_mistral_api_key_here",
           "FIRECRAWL_API_KEY": "your_firecrawl_api_key_here"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   Replace `/absolute/path/to/finagent/main.py` with the actual path to your main.py file.

4. **Restart Claude Desktop**:

   - Quit Claude Desktop completely
   - Relaunch the application
   - The MCP server should now be available

5. **Verify Connection**:

   In Claude Desktop, you should see the financial analysis tools available. Ask Claude:

   ```
   Can you analyze Apple stock for me?
   ```

### Available Tools in Claude Desktop

Once configured, Claude can use these tools:

- **analyze_stock**: Get comprehensive stock analysis with AI insights
- **execute_code**: Run generated Python analysis code
- **get_news**: Fetch latest market news for stocks

### Example Conversations with Claude Desktop

```
You: Analyze Tesla stock performance over the last 6 months

Claude: I'll analyze Tesla stock for you using the financial analysis tool...
[Uses analyze_stock tool]
```

```
You: What's the latest news on NVDA?

Claude: Let me fetch the latest news for NVIDIA...
[Uses get_news tool]
```

```
You: Can you execute this analysis code for me?

Claude: I'll run that code using the execution tool...
[Uses execute_code tool]
```

## Usage

### As MCP Server (Standalone)

Start the MCP server manually:

```bash
python main.py
